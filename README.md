# -Database-Analysis-on-Blinkit-Dataset-
I recently completed Phase 1 of my Social Media Web and Mobile Analytics (SWMA) project, where I conducted a comprehensive database analysis on the Blinkit dataset using Python. The objective was to uncover key insights into customer behavior, purchase patterns, and product performance.

Description:

Analyze customer purchase data from Blinkit to understand consumer behavior, identify key trends in purchasing patterns, and explore the relationships between various product attributes and sales performance metrics. This analysis will provide valuable insights into customer preferences, the effectiveness of discount codes, and the impact of different sales channels.

Objectives:

Insights into Purchase Behavior:

Examine the purchasing patterns of customers across various segments (e.g., "Normal," "Gold") and channels (e.g., "Online," "In-Store") to identify high-performing segments and preferred purchasing channels.
Evaluate the impact of loyalty programs and discounts on purchase decisions.
Trend Analysis:

Analyze purchase trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to identify peak purchasing periods and seasonal preferences for specific product categories.
Identify trends in payment methods, delivery locations, and sentiment patterns across different regions.
Attribute Relationships:

Explore the relationships between product attributes (e.g., "Product Name," "Price," "Rating") and performance metrics (e.g., "Total Amount," "Profit Margin") to determine which attributes are most strongly associated with higher sales and customer satisfaction.
Understand the correlation between customer sentiment, purchase frequency, and customer segments to guide targeted marketing strategies.
